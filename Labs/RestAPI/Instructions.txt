Directly accessing the REST API
-------------------------------
Based on kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/access-cluster-api/

	kubectl handles locating and authenticating to the API server. 
	
	To directly access the REST API 
		e.g using
			
			curl 
			wget
			browser
			
	Multiple ways to locate and authenticate against the API server:
		Run kubectl in proxy mode 
			Recommended
			Uses the stored apiserver location 
			Verifies the identity of the API server using a self-signed cert. 
			No man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is possible using this method.
		Directly provide the location and credentials to the http client. 
			Works with client code 
			To protect against man in the middle attacks
				import a root cert into your browser.

Using the Go or Python client libraries provides accessing kubectl in proxy mode.

1.		Using kubectl proxy
		-------------------
	The following command runs kubectl as a reverse proxy. 
	It handles locating the API server and authenticating.

	kubectl proxy --port=8080 &
	See kubectl proxy for more details.
	Then you can explore the API with curl, wget, or a browser, like so:

	curl http://localhost:8080/api/
	The output is similar to this:

	{
	  "versions": [
		"v1"
	  ],
	  "serverAddressByClientCIDRs": [
		{
		  "clientCIDR": "0.0.0.0/0",
		  "serverAddress": "10.0.1.149:443"
		}
	  ]
	}
